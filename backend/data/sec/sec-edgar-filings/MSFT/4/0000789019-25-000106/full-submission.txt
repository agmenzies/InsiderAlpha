Re:	Microsoft Corporation - Power of Attorney

To whom it may concern:

I revoke my prior Microsoft Corporation - Power of Attorney.
This will confirm that, effective as of the date above, I have
granted each of the individuals listed below the
authority to, on my behalf, execute and file the Statement of
Changes in Beneficial Ownership of Securities (Form 4) and the
Annual Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership (Form 5),
in connection with transactions in Microsoft Corporation securities,
as my Attorney-In-Fact.  Such power of attorney shall remain in full
force and effect until either (i) I am no longer subject to the
reporting requirements under Section 16 of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended or (ii) I have provided you with written notice
withdrawing this authority.

The individuals who are authorized to act as my Attorney-In-Fact
under this Power of Attorney are as follows:

Julia Stark
Benjamin O. Orndorff
Michael Pressman
Keith R. Dolliver
Christyne Mayberry

This Power of Attorney is effective immediately upon filing with the
Securities Exchange Commission and for purposes of my future Form 4
and Form 5 filings relating to Microsoft securities and transactions.
Sincerely,

/s/ John W. Stanton
